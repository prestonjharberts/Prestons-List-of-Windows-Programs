# Prestonâ€™s List of Windows Programs

This is an exhaustive list of every desktop program I have for the Windows operating system. This repository is inspired by [Chiefs Big List of Programs](https://github.com/TheChiefMeat/Chiefs-Big-List-of-Programs) with my own categories for organizing programs.
